## What is this?
For AcademyPGH book club, we wanted to explore some different data structures. I chose to look at a priority queue, where you can insert items with priorities, and the highest priority one is the one you get when you call `pop`.

Herein we have:
- prioritizer.rb: This is a naive implementation using an array as the base data structure and keeping it sorted with .sort.
